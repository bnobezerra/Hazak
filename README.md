Bioinformatic script

A compilled of some simple scripts that i used to save some time when running bioinformatic pipelines with protein datasets, phylogenetic trees, etc.

main.py = run this one, main file that will call all functions;
criteria.py = the actual functions, check this if you need to change something to your use (but pls do not redistribute this without contating me);
arquivo.py = super simple functions that deal with the archives.

WARNING: Be careful using these scripts, most of them OVERWRITE the original file you use. So always keep a copy of your dataset, tree, etc.

Finally, contact me if you have ANY suggestion, i am quite new with programming and all of this. :)
